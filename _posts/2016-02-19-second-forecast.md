The Emma Chisit model updated today in light of a few polls over the last few days. The seat forecast didn't change, and no individual seats changed hands. I'll note that during the intervening period between the first and second updates, Crikey's [Poll Bludger](http://blogs.crikey.com.au/pollbludger/) forecast updated to precisely agree with Emma.
