The Emma Chisit model updated today because of a Newspoll released, tying the ALP and Coalition two-party preferred vote at 50-50. Although most individual seats shifted slightly in the ALP's favour, there was no overall change in the forecasted seat count for a few reasons:

- Emma Chisit's heart is a poll aggregate; this allows for the chance that the Newspoll is an outlier by including older polls with decaying weights
- Newspoll has a pretty bad historical record and so is included in the model with a relatively low weight

The model is definitely detecting movement towards the Coalition, and another couple of polls with similar numbers could start to see the seat forecast drastically change.
