The Emma Chisit model [updated](http://auselections.com/current-forecast/) today after a break which resulted in some changes and improvements to the model and the website. 

There has been one major political announcement since the model's last update: Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull has signified he is willing to use a slew of industrial legislation as a double dissolution trigger which means an early election on July 2 (in less than 13 weeks) is likely. 

As far as polls are concerned, it seems that Turnbull's "honeymoon" period is drawing to a close, and we've seen a number of polls putting the ALP in striking distance of the Coalition, including a particularly ominous Newspoll on April 4 which put the ALP ahead for the first time since the leadership change in September. 

Emma has been a little slow to reflect these changes, but the end result is an improvement of four seats towards the ALP: the model now has them winning 61 seats, a 6-seat improvement from their 2013 result. 

Some improvements to the model I'm currently working on:

- implementing the strong transition model for runoffs as a better model of voter behaviour
- introducing support for marginal polls (the first of the campaign was released last week for the seat of Indi currently held by Independent Cathy McGowan)
- proper support for third-parties

Once all these are implement in a few weeks, Emma Chisit will be fully ready. Any new poll release will trigger the model to update, including generating and uploading a new pendulum and image. I'll keep updating this blog every few days during the campaign as well, hopefully providing some interesting commentary on the process. A reminder that the code for Emma Chisit is available on [this](https://github.com/clintonboys/emma-chisit-site) Github repository.
