    &lt;p&gt;The Emma Chisit model &lt;a href=&quot;http://auselections.com/current-forecast/&quot;&gt;updated&lt;/a&gt; today after a break which resulted in some changes and improvements to the model and the website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There has been one major political announcement since the model’s last update: Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull has signified he is willing to use a slew of industrial legislation as a double dissolution trigger which means an early election on July 2 (in less than 13 weeks) is likely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As far as polls are concerned, it seems that Turnbull’s “honeymoon” period is drawing to a close, and we’ve seen a number of polls putting the ALP in striking distance of the Coalition, including a particularly ominous Newspoll on April 4 which put the ALP ahead for the first time since the leadership change in September.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Emma has been a little slow to reflect these changes, but the end result is an improvement of four seats towards the ALP: the model now has them winning 61 seats, a 6-seat improvement from their 2013 result.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some improvements to the model I’m currently working on:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;implementing the strong transition model for runoffs as a better model of voter behaviour&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;introducing support for marginal polls (the first of the campaign was released last week for the seat of Indi currently held by Independent Cathy McGowan)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;proper support for third-parties&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once all these are implement in a few weeks, Emma Chisit will be fully ready. Any new poll release will trigger the model to update, including generating and uploading a new pendulum and image. I’ll keep updating this blog every few days during the campaign as well, hopefully providing some interesting commentary on the process. A reminder that the code for Emma Chisit is available on &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/clintonboys/emma-chisit-site&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; Github repository.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/update/&quot;&gt;More polls and more movement towards the ALP&lt;/a&gt; was originally published by  at &lt;a href=&quot;&quot;&gt;Emma Chisit&lt;/a&gt; on December 29, 2018.&lt;/p&gt;
